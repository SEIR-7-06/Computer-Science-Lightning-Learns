## Lightning Learn!
For this activity we will getting a chance to explore various Data Structures in Computer Science.

## What will you be doing?
You will be assigned a random team today along with a new topic that you will be researching and implementing as a proof of concept. You will find that these concepts help you in solving programming questions. You may find that some of these are a bit above your skill level.  The main focus is to learn something new and share with your fellow classmates.

## Deliverables
  - A 10 minute presentation on your assigned topic!
  - You will research the topic and become subject matter experts!
  - The format of the presentation will be up to you and your team. You could present your topic via a README.md, a Miro board, PowerPoint slides, etc.
  - The goal of the presentation is to summarize and present your learnings in a digestible format! 
  
### You will need:
  - To explain the concept behind the topic assigned to your group.
  - To outline different types of problems that can be solved using the given data structure. 
  - Links to all relevant resources. This can include the software's site, a helpful tutorial site, a medium article, etc.
  - Show real world examples of the data structure in use, if possible!
  - And optionally, you can also prepare code snippets that show some basic implementation details.
