## Lightning Learn!
As a developer it is extremely important to demonstrate an understanding of data structures & Algorithms.

## What will you be doing?
You will be assigned a random team today along with a new topic that you will be researching and implementing as a proof of concept. You will find that these concepts help you in solving programming questions. You may find that some of these are a bit above your skill level.  The main focus is to learn something new and share with your fellow classmates.
